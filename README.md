I think this may be flagged :(

due to the tests breaking by running formatters (prettier) i had to rebase back to chapter 4 - I talked to a demonstrator about this (was week one tho)

unfourunetly the rebase has nuked the time stamp of commits such that it looks like i did most of it in three minutes oops 

sorry for the inconvenience
